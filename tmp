        <p>A library of bimatrix game generators to complement the GAMUT generator with
instances of games focusing on approximation algorithms. The game classes
implemented are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Colonel Blotto Games</strong>: The players in this game have an army with equal number
of troops T, which they can then divide and dispatch to n battlefields (hills). Each
player has a personal valuation for each hill which is received if the
player has more troops than the opponent on that hill. In case of ties, the
winner of the hill is choosen uniformly at random.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ranking Games</strong>: In ranking games, each player puts in an effort which comes at
a cost and results in a score. The values of cost and score are monotone
increasing in the amount of effort put in. The players are then ranked based
on their score where the player with the higher score recieves a prize p, and
in cases where a tie occurs, the players split the prize between them. Each
players payoff is given by the value of the prize earned minus the cost of the
effort put in.</li>
<li>
<strong>SGC Games</strong>: These games were created as a worst case scenario for support
enumeration as it has a unique equilibrium where each player uses half of his
actions in his support profile.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tournament Games</strong>: Starting from an arbitrary tournament graph with n nodes, an
asymmetric bipartite graph is created where the nodes on one side (partition
R) correspond to the nodes of the tournament graph, and the nodes on the other
(partition C)side correspond to the k-sized subsets of nodes in the tournament 
graph. The bipartite graph is then transformed into a win-lose game where the 
actions of each player are nodes on their side of the graph.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unit vector Games</strong>: The payoffs of the column player are selected uniformly at
random from the range [0, 1], while in the row player has each column of his
payoff matrix being a unit vector.</li>
</ul>
