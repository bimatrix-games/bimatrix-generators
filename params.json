{"name":"Bimatrix-generators","tagline":"","body":"A library of bimatrix game generators to complement the GAMUT generator with\r\ninstances of games focusing on approximation algorithms. The game classes\r\nimplemented are as follows:\r\n\r\n- **Colonel Blotto Games**: The players in this game have an army with equal number\r\n  of troops T, which they can then divide and dispatch to n battlefields (hills). Each\r\n  player has a personal valuation for each hill which is received if the\r\n  player has more troops than the opponent on that hill. In case of ties, the\r\n  winner of the hill is choosen uniformly at random.\r\n- **Ranking Games**: In ranking games, each player puts in an effort which comes at\r\n  a cost and results in a score. The values of cost and score are monotone\r\n  increasing in the amount of effort put in. The players are then ranked based\r\n  on their score where the player with the higher score recieves a prize p, and\r\n  in cases where a tie occurs, the players split the prize between them. Each\r\n  players payoff is given by the value of the prize earned minus the cost of the\r\n  effort put in.\r\n- **SGC Games**: These games were created as a worst case scenario for support\r\n  enumeration as it has a unique equilibrium where each player uses half of his\r\n  actions in his support profile.\r\n- **Tournament Games**: Starting from an arbitrary tournament graph with n nodes, an\r\n  asymmetric bipartite graph is created where the nodes on one side (partition\r\n  R) correspond to the nodes of the tournament graph, and the nodes on the other\r\n  (partition C)side correspond to the k-sized subsets of nodes in the tournament \r\n  graph. The bipartite graph is then transformed into a win-lose game where the \r\n  actions of each player are nodes on their side of the graph.\r\n- **Unit vector Games**: The payoffs of the column player are selected uniformly at\r\n  random from the range [0, 1], while in the row player has each column of his\r\n  payoff matrix being a unit vector.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
